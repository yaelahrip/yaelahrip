## 🔐 Interests

I'm deeply immersed in the fields of **web security**, **reverse engineering**, and **software development**. My programming toolkit spans a wide range of languages and frameworks:

- 🐘 PHP | 🟢 Node.js | 🐍 Python | 🔵 C# / VB.NET / VB6  
- 💻 C / C++ | 💡 JavaScript | 🤖 Exploring Machine Learning

I'm especially fascinated by low-level internals, protocol tampering, and crafting unconventional solutions that bypass security boundaries.

📚 Continuous Learning — I Eat Everything in IT 🍽️💻

As a fast learner with a generalist brain, I thrive in rapid exploration and deep dives across the full spectrum of Information Technology. I don’t just “learn” — I absorb, dissect, and experiment with everything from low-level exploits to high-level AI.

Here’s what currently fuels my intellectual appetite:
🌐 Advanced InfoSec & Web App Security

    🔎 Web exploitation, bug bounty hunting, bypassing WAFs/CDNs
    🧩 OWASP Top 10 mastery and beyond (Business Logic Bugs, SSRF, CSRF chaining)
    🔒 Session hijacking, insecure deserialization, advanced XSS payloads
    🌍 Recon automation (subdomain brute force, DNS history, certificate transparency)
    🔍 Fingerprinting technologies and bypassing obfuscation mechanisms

🧠 Machine Learning & AI Integration

    🤖 Prompt engineering, generative AI (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini), and applied NLP
    🔍 ML-powered security tools: anomaly detection, phishing classifiers, captcha breakers
    🧬 Fine-tuning models for niche tasks like code review or malware classification
    🔁 Automating AI pipelines in real-world systems (chatbots, auto-pentesters, etc.)

⚙️ Systems Programming, Automation & Tooling

    🛠 Building custom tools in C/C++ for performance or evasion
    🐚 Scripting automation in Bash, Python, and Node.js to replace repetitive workflows
    📊 Creating dashboards, schedulers, CLI tools, and native Windows services
    🔄 API reverse engineering and protocol fuzzing (especially undocumented ones)

🧰 Reverse Engineering, Internals & Obfuscation

    🔍 Inspecting malware, binaries, and obfuscated code (PE, ELF, APK, JavaScript)
    🔧 Hooking functions, dynamic analysis, debugging with IDA/OllyDbg/x64dbg
    🛡 Patching logic gates, license checkers, and anti-debugging tricks
    🔙 Understanding undocumented behavior in APIs, SDKs, firmware

## 🤝 Open to Collaboration

I'm always excited to collaborate on meaningful projects that:

- 🧪 Push boundaries in cybersecurity or reverse engineering  
- ⚡ Involve rapid prototyping, automation, or unconventional tools  
- 📦 Tackle real-world problems with elegant technical solutions  

If you have a cool idea or a security-focused side project — let’s connect!
